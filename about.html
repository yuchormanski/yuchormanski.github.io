        <p class="info">This game is build as a custom project as a way to test new learned skills in Javascript
            language while
            studying in Softuni. Everything is writhen and there is nothing "copy-paste"-ed in order to gain and
            practising the new learned skills.

            The game is not Ð° part of homework or other exercise from the course in Softuni. It a private decision and
            as such it brings some mistakes and incompleteness.

            I tried to do every part of the project including "FavIcon" - stupid pixel by pixel drawing. The only part
            that is web resource is bull head for background changing, but also moded by me in two colors according
            requirements of the theme.
            And ,yes , the dark theme is inspired by the GutHub dark theme...</p>
