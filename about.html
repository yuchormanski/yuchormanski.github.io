        <p class="info">This game is build as a custom project as a way to test new learned skills in Javascript language while
            studying in Softuni. Everything is writhen and there is nothing "copy-paste"-ed in order to gain and
            practising the new learned skills.
            The main purpose was logic, after that the front end and design. As game requirements are - user to gues the
            random generated number. The machine answers according users input number is there a part of it that is
            included or is on the exact place and so on ...
            The game is not Ð° part of homework or other exercise from the course in Softuni. It a private decision and
            as such it brings some mistakes and incompleteness.
            I tried to do every part of the project including "FavIcon" - stupid pixel by pixel drawing. The only part
            that is web resource is bull head to change the background, also moded by me in two colors according
            requirements of the theme.
            And ,yes , the dark theme is inspired by the GutHub dark theme...</p>
